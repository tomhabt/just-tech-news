# About
This project is about re-create some functionality that Hacker News implements. On Hacker News, a user posts an article from another source and other users vote or comment on the post. This type of data relationship is used in social applications all over the web, but it can be a little tricky to implement. Re-creating this is the perfect project to push us to learn new skills!
The Hacker News website (Links to an external site.) to become familiar with the functionality. 

As you probably previosuly noticed, 'Hacker News', a popular website to post articles by users, has a minimalist front end. But it has a robust back end that connects a lot of data—and that's what we'll focus on in this module. By the end of the project, it is set up to have  a working API with data that spans multiple related MySQL tables.

This project is to demonstation ORM Object Relational Mapping in Node JS and  specially a well known ORM library called Sequelize that play a great role between client-server and the database of Mysql.
